            <p>
              I'm a junior front-end developer. I enjoy working on interesting
                projects, of real value to the end-user. I work mostly with vanilla
                JavaScript and am also comfortable with Python and the Django framework.
            </p>
            <p>

          </div>

          <div id="background" class="font_colour">
            <h2 class="handwriting">Background</h2>
            <p>After a few stints working for different startups (Streetcar, which
              was aqcuired by Zipcar, RateSetter - one of the largest peer-to-peer
              lenders in the UK), and running my own business, I started working at
              Marvel. I spent nearly two years doing everything from testing, bug
              reports, data analysis and data visualisation. The great thing about
              working in a startup is that everything is new and unchartered, meaning
              you have the opportunity to dip your hand in everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              A large portion of my time was spent working alongside the dev team,
              especially in the run-up to new releases.
              It wasn't long before I went from testing and reporting bugs, to poking around in our systems,
              then peaking under the hood and trying to learn about how things actually worked.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started off with Code Academy, learning the basics of HTML and CSS,
              moving onto Treehouse and using Youtube, Stack, Medium and anything
              else I could get my hands on. I found Codebar and still religiously attend.
            </p>

          <div id="projects" class="font_colour">
            <h2 class="handwriting">Projects</h2>
            <p>
              I'm currently enjoying getting stuck into my own personal projects,
              focussing on expanding my knowledge and and skill set.

            <h3>The Next Step</h3>

            <p>The Next Step is a tool for creating a more personable, modern CV. The idea
              is that instead of creating static resumes using outdated text editors,
              users can create resumes which show the best of their skills and experience.
              </p>
            <p>I got the idea for The Next Step when transitioning between careers
              and building this site. I had great fun creating something unique to
              represent me but it struck how difficult it would be for people from
              a non-technical background to showcase their own work in the same way.</p>
            <p>It navigates away from conventional editors such as Microsoft Word
              and Google Docs, created in an era where documents were created to
              be printed. The traditional editor bar is replaced with a light-weight
              tooltop menu, drawing inspiration from modern editors such as Dropbox Paper,
              Quip and Medium.</p>
              <p>The stack: the backend is built in Python, using the Django framework.
                The front-end is HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript. AJAX is used to
                send the user's resume content to the database, and again to populate
                the resume each time the page is loaded. </p>
